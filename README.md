# map-painless-prefill
Python script that helps you pre-fill painless map.

To get it started, just edit the BAT file and insert the name of your map, and start it. As a result, it will generate:
spss_map_savfile_MDDConvert.xlsx
in the same directory. Just grab contents from columns A-P

Enjoy

Please note, there is no "pause" at the end. If it disappears, it means everything worked and finished successfully.

I tested it on a couple of projects, so far everything looks perfect.

You also need python and IBM/Unicom Professional to have this tool running. It is a requirement.

If some python packages are missing, just type
`python -m pip install xxx`
where xxx is a missing package.
